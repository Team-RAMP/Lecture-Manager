Timely is a one-stop personalized solution for easily keeping track of your lectures. 

Knowing the lectures you have attended, the ones you haven't; querying what has been covered in those lectures, covering up in the ones you haven't attended and to gain detailed and useful insights of your attendance can be a hectic task.

Timely can be used to track your everyday lectures, as it visualizes the timetable in a recurring format and you just have to mark your presenty. You can then check your progress status on the dashboard overview where subject-wise stats are shown.

Our features:

-Vizualizing time-table

-Recurring the time-table every week

-Easy input of the tt

-Overview of the entire month and subject-wise as well

-Taking subject-wise notes

-Managing academics efficiently
